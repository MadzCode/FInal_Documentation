# Development Commentary Template

## Project Outline
- ~~At Death We Part is a 2.5D platformer with light and dark mechanics to help the player progress in the story. There is two characters one who has light powers and can only stand in light, and the other who has dark powers and can only stand in darkness.~~ 

- At Death we part is a 2.5D Platformer that utalises light and dark mechanics to help the player progress through the level. The character will have two states; A light state and a dark state, this allows the player to pass through the shadow areas whislt in the dark state and the light areas whist in the dark state. This then allows the player to stand on platforms of the oppisite state (Light character can stand on the dark areas and vise versa).

- My inital goal is to create a functional swapping mechanic for the player that I can then add to by adding powers to the different states and the making puzzles around that. Then after that is completed I will then add more mechanics and polish to the game.    

- The most immediate challange I may face is making the light mechanic work and only light up the part of the platform it is touching. Another issue may be miscommunication from teammembers.  

## Research

### Methodology  

### Game Sources  
- Ori and the Blind Forest:
Ori is a 2.5 Platformer game where the main character 'Ori' traverses through the world gaining powerups as he goes. I found the 2.5D artstyle to look very interesting with this almost storybook looking artstyle.

- "Ori and the Blind Forest's gameplay combines platformer elements with open-world exporation (metroidvania). Players control Ori who can jump, run on walls and use various abilities to overcome obstacles and fight enemies."
Find Sources that talk about oris gameplay mechanics."

(ProgKids, 2025)


- Inside:
Inside is a 2.5D game where the player must travel though a bleak empty world to using the environment to put together the story and figure out the characters objective.


“Sequences were often shuffled around, broken apart and recombined to suit the evolution of the story and to make sure that mechanics and visual cues were shown to the player in the correct order, setting up subsequent encounters,” says Bogdan.

(Wiltshire, 2017)

## Implementation

# Camera Mechanic

- For the Camera Mechanic I want the camera to be on a static spline, when the player leaves the room the camera will fly to the next room.

- I fixed the way the camera was facing but now I need to make it so the camera is segmented.

- Spline Movement BP:
<iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/d6-zmgms/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- I wasn't a fan of how this looked so I used the Residant Evil camera system as a reference and implemented it into the game.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UTj87aCSJpA?si=NK0UW5SZVROZyuN1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


- I didnt like how the camera moved so I disabled the movement and made the camera completly static.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/78SvbqNOx20?si=eJhKqkQgd9OX1Gfr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- Later on the designer changed the old system to a spine camera system where the camera moves to different set of prepositioned points. This allows the player to experience smooth camera transitions instead of my snappier ones.

# 2D Movement & Animation

 - I decided to remake the old third person character template with a 2D one created by the artist of the group. This new 2D character is a better fit for the 2.5D astetic that we are going for in this game.
 - I animated this character by using the paperZD plugin (Critical Failure Studio, 2017.) which allows for easier implementation of 2D characters.
 - To implement the character into a PaperZDCharacter class I first made the sprites into a flipbook and animated it changed the frame every 6 frames for 15 frames.

- I Added the new sprite to the Player_BP
- To make the lighting more releastic I added cast shadow in the details tab, this will make the lighting look more realistic on the character.
- To ensure that this works in the matarials I added a MaskedLitSpriteMaterial so that the light works on the character correctly.
![alt text](image-12.png)

## Flash Light System

- I was looking into creating a 2D flashlight for the game but I was unsure how to impliment it so I looked at copilot to help me learn about how to create it.
![alt text](image-14.png)
![alt text](image-15.png)

- After tweaking the flashlight I managed to make it work correctly when the player turns left.

## Flickering Light System
- for a simple puzzle idea I created a light that toggles every 3 seconds.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nydL_rrPxJU?si=iSorcX9ErV-XIV3J" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Cursor mechanic
- To make the game feel more stylisied I added a custom cursor to the game, this step was easy but I am eventually going to make the cursor change when clicked to be more visual.

<img src="https://raw.github.com/MadzCode/FInal_Documentation/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202025-05-23%20022627.png" width="75%"/>
## Animated shadow texture 
- I animated a simple animation for the shadow platforms. I requested for the shadow to look more like squiggles, this helps the game to look more like a picture book that had been drawn into.

- I used Copilot to give me an idea of how to smoothly cycle between the frames so it looks like the squiggles are moving rather than switching in between frames.

### New Approaches  

## Light System
- Due to time constraints and being repeatedly let down by my designer I had to remake the entire game idea from scratch whilst trying to keep the overall theme of loss and acceptence in tact. Instead of having 5 levels there will now be one giant level with 3 sections (attic, bedroom, basement) and the movement controls and mechanics have been simplified indefinitely or when we meet schecule deadlines. This change was unfortunate as I wanted to trust the designers reassurance that he would get everything done on time, however, they never delivered. I have also diminished the designers rights and I am now acting as lead designer and I have stationed the old designer to doing backround assets and sound design.

## Camera System
- originally the player camera was going to be static and fly to the next room when the player walked into it, However, I found the spline to be finicky so I gave the camera a more standard look. If I have some spare time I will look into creating it again. But for now the camera works as intended. 
- Detail any innovative or new approaches you explored during the project.  
- Explain why these approaches were chosen and how they differ from standard practices.  
- Evaluate the success of these approaches, including any challenges faced and lessons learned.

## 2 player system

- I have scrapped the 2 player system and instead I have one sprite followed by a small ghost to give the same effect.

### Testing
- Document the user testing conducted, specifying the type of tests used (e.g., automated testing, guided user testing, blind testing).  
- Present feedback or issues identified during testing, using graphs, tables, or visual aids to summarise results.  
- Describe how these issues were addressed. If any issues were not resolved, provide a clear justification for leaving them unaddressed.

## Technical Difficulties

## Camera System

- The camera is not looking at the correct location, cannot rotate camera
- Identify any technical difficulties encountered during the implementation phase.  
- I was having an issue of being able to turn the camera even though the game was in 2D making the movement controls weird. This was a simple fix I just added the mouse onto the screen all the time to disable camera movement. It is also set up for the power mechanics which will need the mouse to operate.

<iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/d6-zmgms/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- Provide details on how these issues were diagnosed and resolved.  
- If any difficulties remain unresolved, explain the impact on the project and any mitigation strategies used to minimise their effect.  
- Reflect on what you would do differently in future projects to avoid similar issues.

## Flash Light System
- After asking Copilot to help me create a Flashlight I noticed a bug, the code would work perfectly when I turned to face the left the code would not work as intended.

## Reflection
- After working in a group I realised that choosing reliable team members is a must, having just one team member not play their part can have a devastating effect on the production progress and put more work onto my plate in the longrun. After some thought my next game will be a solo project and I may use the original idea of my prototype.

- I should have also stopped putting off work as it added more work for me later on, causing delays for the timeline I had set for myself.

### Research Effectiveness  
- Assess the usefulness of the research conducted during the project.  
- Highlight which sources (games, academic, documentation) had the most significant impact on your work and explain why.  
- Identify any research gaps or areas where additional information could have improved your project outcomes.

### Positive Analysis 
- I enjoyed working on this project applying what i know into the project to create a better and more efficient game then I would have been able to do before.

- I liked the challenge of creating a 2.5D game as it allowed me to learn how to do some things differently such as, changing the camera and movement systems.

- (Add Screenshots and other sources)

### Group Positive Analysis
- Working as a group has been positive in some ways as it is nice to give everyone their designated tasks to help split the workload as a whole.

- I enjoyed managing my group and giving them different asignments to help improve the game, from asking my artist to create different assets that will help improve the games overall storytelling, to asking my designer to create music using the different themes and instruments I chose to make the music more immersive and emotional.

- (add screenshots and other sources to help prove these statements)

### Negative Analysis
- Working on this project has taught me about the importance of team communication, as I have learned that miscommunication or missed group deadlines can almost halt the team workflow.

- During this project I took on the role of a unofficial team leader, I didn't feel confident in this role and found it increased my workload quite significantly. My initial thought that the game designer who created the original idea for the game would take on that role. However, the designer did not contribute as much to the project as i hoped he would. This lead to missed group deadlines that I organised, as well as tension within the group. To help the team workflow I reassigned the designer to simpler tasks. Such as, background level and audio design.   

- If I were to create this project again, I would make sure that the roles and responsibilities given out would better suit my team members to avoid missed deadlines and help communication.


### Next Time

- If I was to do this project again I would make sure that I chose team members that would do their part to ensure that the game is completed in a timely manner.

-I would have made sure that they would update the trello board often this time so I could better see where they were struggling or if they needed more time to do something.

- I Would also make sure the game would be less ambitious before as originally there were going to be five levels, which is possible but I need to consider things going wrong like it has here, then if I am ahead of scedule I could add stretch goals to help polish the game and make it more publishable.

- One thing I struggled with last time was documentation as I would just put everything I did into the notes making it unorganised and hard to find what I am looking for immedietly, costing me time that could be spent on working on the project.
