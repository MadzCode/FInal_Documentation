# Development Commentary Template

## Project Outline
- At Death We Part is a 2.5D platformer with light and dark mechanics to help the player progress in the story. There is two characters one who has light powers and can only stand in light, asnd the other who has dark powers and can only stand in darkness. 
- My inital goal is to create a functional core mechanic that I can then add to. Then after that is completed I will then add more mechanics and polish to the game.    
- The most immediate challange I may face is making the light mechanic work and only light up the part of the platform it is touching. Another issue may be miscommunication from teammembers.  

## Research

### Methodology  
- Identify relevant sources for the project, including articles, documentation, talks, and games.  
- Detail how these sources have informed your practical work and influenced your approach.

### Game Sources  
- Conduct research on games that are relevant to your project. Provide a brief description of each game and the insights it offers.  
- Analyse the game's approach, cross-referencing it with other sources such as articles or talks to support your analysis.  
- Explain how these insights apply to your project and influence your decision-making process.

### Academic Sources  
- Research academic papers, books, or articles that provide theoretical guidance for your project. Include a brief summary of each source.  
- Describe how the academic research applies to your project and shapes your design and development decisions.

### Documentation Sources

### Process
- Provide a step-by-step breakdown of your development process, including key milestones and decisions made throughout the project.  
- Highlight any tools, frameworks, or techniques used, and explain how they contributed to the implementation.  
- Include screenshots, diagrams, or code snippets where relevant to showcase your progress.

### New Approaches  
- Detail any innovative or new approaches you explored during the project.  
- Explain why these approaches were chosen and how they differ from standard practices.  
- Evaluate the success of these approaches, including any challenges faced and lessons learned.

### Testing
- Document the user testing conducted, specifying the type of tests used (e.g., automated testing, guided user testing, blind testing).  
- Present feedback or issues identified during testing, using graphs, tables, or visual aids to summarise results.  
- Describe how these issues were addressed. If any issues were not resolved, provide a clear justification for leaving them unaddressed.

### Technical Difficulties
- Identify any technical difficulties encountered during the implementation phase.  
- Provide details on how these issues were diagnosed and resolved.  
- If any difficulties remain unresolved, explain the impact on the project and any mitigation strategies used to minimise their effect.  
- Reflect on what you would do differently in future projects to avoid similar issues.

## Outcomes

### Source Code/Project Files
- Provide a link to your complete source code or project files.  
- Ensure the link is publicly accessible or shared with the appropriate permissions.  
- Include a brief description of the files provided, highlighting key components or any instructions required to run the project.

### Build Link
- Share a link to a playable or executable build of your project.  
- Ensure the build is accessible across relevant platforms and is publicly accessible.  
- Include any necessary instructions for running the build, such as system requirements or installation steps.

### Video Demonstration

- First Attempt


- Embed a video or provide a link to a recorded demonstration of your project in action.  
- The video should showcase key features, functionality, and any unique elements of your project.  
- Include a brief commentary or text overlay in the video to explain the different aspects of your project as they are shown.

## Reflection

### Research Effectiveness  
- Assess the usefulness of the research conducted during the project.  
- Highlight which sources (games, academic, documentation) had the most significant impact on your work and explain why.  
- Identify any research gaps or areas where additional information could have improved your project outcomes.

### Positive Analysis 
- Reflect on the successful aspects of the project.  
- Highlight specific elements that worked well, such as technical solutions, creative decisions, or user feedback.  
- Provide evidence to support your analysis, such as test results, screenshots, or user comments.

### Negative Analysis  
- Identify the areas of the project that did not go as planned or could have been improved.  
- Discuss challenges you faced, whether technical, creative, or time-related, and evaluate their impact on the final product.  
- Reflect on any mistakes or missteps and what you learned from them.

### Next Time
- Outline what you would do differently if you were to undertake a similar project again.  
- Suggest improvements to your workflow, research methods, or implementation process based on your reflections.  
- Consider any new tools, techniques, or approaches you would explore in future projects to achieve better results.

## Bibliography  
- Compile a complete list of all sources referenced throughout your project. This may include articles, journals, videos, games, software, documentation, or any other materials.  
- Ensure all references are formatted according to the [university's citation method](https://mylibrary.uca.ac.uk/referencing).  
- Organise your references in alphabetical order. Alternatively, you may separate them by type (e.g., academic sources, games, videos), but consistency is key.

## Declared Assets
- Provide a detailed list of any third-party assets used in the project.  
- This includes asset packs, music, sound effects, 3D models, textures, scripts, or code from external sources.  
- Declare any use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Meshy) or pre-existing code. Specify the purpose of these assets/tools and how they were integrated into your work.  
- Ensure you clearly distinguish between your original work and any external contributions to maintain academic integrity.
