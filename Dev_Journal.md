# Development Commentary Template

## Project Outline

- At Death we part is a 2.5D Platformer that utalises light and dark mechanics to help the player progress through the level. The character will have two states; A light state and a dark state, this allows the player to pass through the shadow areas whislt in the dark state and the light areas whist in the dark state. This then allows the player to stand on platforms of the oppisite state (Light character can stand on the dark areas and vise versa).

- My inital goal is to create a functional swapping mechanic for the player that I can then add to by adding powers to the different states and the making puzzles around that. Then after that is completed I will then add more mechanics and polish to the game.    

- The most immediate challange I may face is making the light mechanic work and only light up the part of the platform it is touching. Another issue may be miscommunication from teammembers.  

## Research


### Methodology  

- Since I am working in a group project I feel the best methodology would be Agile methodology.

- "Agile is an approach that divides work into phases, emphasizing continuous delivery and improvement. The Agile methodology benefits teams by enabling adaptive planning, rapid execution, and ongoing evaluation, leading to more responsive and successful outcomes." (Atlassian, n.d.)

- With this in mind the group project should go smoothly as long as everyone sticks to their deadlines. I will be hosting constant meetings weekly to help ensure everyone is where they need to be and if there is any trouble I can quickly fix it, this is to avoid people keeping their issues to theirself which could hinder the entire group.

### Game Mechanic Sources  


At Death we part was inspired by a few different games those being:

## Paper Mario

- The games artistic insperation relies heavily on Paper Mario (Nintendo of Europe SE, 2004). The 2.5D style was very visualy appealing with the 2D sprites on a 3D world. After discussing with my group it became the main characters and other NPC's main aesthetic.

- All of these characters have quirky personalities which makes them enjoyable to listen from and learn about.

- The fun mini games also make this game truly unforgetable as you can be playing bingo one moment and fighting dragons the next. 

## Little Nightmares

- Whilst brainstorming the game we considered many options one of those being to make this game into a puzzle platformer horror game. I suggested Little Nightmares (Little Nightmares on Steam, 2017) as this is one of the best examples of this.

- Litle Nightmares excelles at adding suspence to always keep the player on edge. whether that would be falling platforms or hiding from a mutated blind man. Its way of storytelling intreged me and I hope to use that immersive storytelling inside my game as well.


### Academic Sources  

- Ori and the Blind Forest:
Ori is a 2.5 Platformer game where the main character 'Ori' traverses through the world gaining powerups as he goes. I found the 2.5D artstyle to look very interesting with this almost storybook looking artstyle.



- "Ori and the Blind Forest's gameplay combines platformer elements with open-world exporation. Players control Ori who can jump, run on walls and use various abilities to overcome obstacles and fight enemies."
Find Sources that talk about oris gameplay mechanics."

(ProgKids, 2025)

- Learning this about Ori gives me ideas for my project such as, creating a fast platformer game with abilities you gain whilst playing the game.

- Inside:
Inside is a 2.5D game where the player must travel though a bleak empty world to using the environment to put together the story and figure out the characters objective.


“Sequences were often shuffled around, broken apart and recombined to suit the evolution of the story and to make sure that mechanics and visual cues were shown to the player in the correct order, setting up subsequent encounters,” says Bogdan.

(Wiltshire, 2017)

- Inside gives me the idea to make the game gritter and to add some horror elements to the game to make it more memorable.

- This tutorial allowed me to understand the basics of a flashlight, I had to do more research on my own on hoe to apply this to 3D though.

## Implementation

# Camera Mechanic

- For the Camera Mechanic I want the camera to be on a static spline, when the player leaves the room the camera will fly to the next room.

-![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/685477d2-3b9f-4bc2-ab77-65d83dccc652)

- I fixed the way the camera was facing but now I need to make it so the camera is segmented.

- Spline Movement BP:
<iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/d6-zmgms/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- I wasn't a fan of how this looked so I used the Residant Evil camera system as a reference and implemented it into the game.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UTj87aCSJpA?si=NK0UW5SZVROZyuN1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


- I didnt like how the camera moved so I disabled the movement and made the camera completly static.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/78SvbqNOx20?si=eJhKqkQgd9OX1Gfr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- Later on the designer changed the old system to a spine camera system where the camera moves to different set of prepositioned points. This allows the player to experience smooth camera transitions instead of my snappier ones.

# 2D Movement & Animation

 - I decided to remake the old third person character template with a 2D one created by the artist of the group. This new 2D character is a better fit for the 2.5D astetic that we are going for in this game.
 - I animated this character by using the paperZD plugin (Critical Failure Studio, 2017.) which allows for easier implementation of 2D characters.
 - To implement the character into a PaperZDCharacter class I first made the sprites into a flipbook and animated it changed the frame every 6 frames for 15 frames.

- I Added the new sprite to the Player_BP
- To make the lighting more releastic I added cast shadow in the details tab, this will make the lighting look more realistic on the character.
- To ensure that this works in the matarials I added a MaskedLitSpriteMaterial so that the light works on the character correctly.

## Flash Light System

- I was looking into creating a 2D flashlight for the game but I was unsure how to impliment it so I looked at copilot to help me learn about how to create it.
<img src="https://github.com/MadzCode/FInal_Documentation/blob/main/Images/image-14.png?raw=true" width="75%"/>
<img src="https://github.com/MadzCode/FInal_Documentation/blob/main/Images/image-15.png?raw=true" width="75%"/>


- After tweaking the flashlight I managed to make it work correctly when the player turns left.

## Flickering Light System
- for a simple puzzle idea I created a light that toggles every 3 seconds.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nydL_rrPxJU?si=iSorcX9ErV-XIV3J" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Cursor mechanic
- To make the game feel more stylisied I added a custom cursor to the game, this step was easy but I am eventually going to make the cursor change when clicked to be more visual.

<img src="https://github.com/MadzCode/FInal_Documentation/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202025-05-23%20022627.png?raw=true" width="75%"/>

## Animated shadow texture 

- I animated a simple animation for the shadow platforms. I requested for the shadow to look more like squiggles, this helps the game to look more like a picture book that had been drawn into.

- I used Copilot to give me an idea of how to smoothly cycle between the frames so it looks like the squiggles are moving rather than switching in between frames.


## Shadow Platform Mechanic

- I was tasked with creating a platform that spawns under the player. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OlqX7w6WZM8?si=QZUzs6syOdBDekgO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/e3ixd4qt/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- after that the basics of the shadow platform was done and all that needed to be done was to add a timer onto the shadow platform to avoid being able to use the plaetforms to walk over obsticles.

- A common complaint whilst game testing was that you had infinite platforms so they would just be able to walk over the obsticles to get to the end of the game.

- With the help of the designer I was able to limit the amount of times the player can use the platform, I limited it to around a second. I also created some circular progress bars to go over the circular widgets that was given to me by my artist.

<img src="https://github.com/MadzCode/FInal_Documentation/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202025-05-23%20042834.png?raw=true" width="75%"/>

## Light Dash Mechanic

- I was also tasked with creating a light dash mechanic to give the player more manouverability and to allow the light state character to have a state of its own.

- I created a simple dash that allows the player to temporarily increase their momentum.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k_K-ysj9XV4?si=-otZ2BNojR6YH501" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- The designer rewrote my code after this to different dash code that makes you stop midair whilst dashing temporarily.

## Moving Spline Platforms

- To create more of a enjoyable platforming experience I created some moving spline platforms to allow for more interesting levels.

- There originally was an issue with the verticle platforms where the platforms would spin at the the top of the spline, however with my designer we were able to figure out the issue and quickly fix it. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bWCot5U_zLQ?si=U8_y3sxRXvFtz7Dp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/ix-6jzzi/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Credits Screen

- To credit the people who worked on and contributed to this game I created a credits screen to ensure everyone was mentioned.

- The credits is triggered by a collision box behind the door which will play the credits then take you to the main menu.

<iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/9pvlqgtt/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Main Menu 

- To add functionality to the game I created a main manu and pause screen to the game to allow them to change settings, pause, or quit the game.

- Originally I had a base button and all of the buttons would be the same colour but the designer added some sprites to the buttons to maike them look more stylised.

## Settings Menu

- To allow the players to change the resolution and graphics settings in the game I created a simple settings screen. It is very basic but it allows for basic changes and to be able to quit the game.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/osoZx_PaqaQ?si=Xq_AxUo1DzkFlIyf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Jump Pad

- Originally this was intended to be a jump pad, but it got reused as a jump pad to avoid repeated issues.

- Once the player presses spacebar on the green marked areas they will be shot to the left and have their controls temporarily disabled so they do not accidently move and break the momentum.

## Flying Ghost AI

- After looking online I couldn't find any tutorials for a 2D flying monster, so I asked copilot about how to create it. However I wasn't given any answers so I consulted a classmate.

<img src="https://github.com/MadzCode/FInal_Documentation/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202025-05-23%20072736.png?raw=true" width="75%"/>


- Thanks to my fellow student Evie Green I was able to create a working 2D flying ghost.

- The Ghost now will chase you whilst you are in its collision box and kill you when it touches you.

## Ground Ghost

- This ground ghost is just a simple flipbook that changes into a angry state if the player gets too near to it.

## Door / Key Mechanic

- To give the game a objective I created a door and key system, the player must collect 3 keys in order to pass though the door. 
- I thank my fellow student Evie Green for assisting me on making the 3 key mechanic work.

## Dialogue System

- To make the game more immersive I made a dialogue system.
- To create the script I used a CSV file then imported it into Unreal to use as the dialogue sheet. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GnCaqmOmhQ?si=qBwo4DZcJ9nFjqMF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- The text was later altered for the new dialogue that you see now.

## NPC FLoating animation

- I added a small animation onto the tutorial ghosts in the background and also added a collision box when you are close to show you can talk to them.

### New Approaches  

## Light System
- Due to time constraints and being repeatedly let down by my designer I had to remake the entire game idea from scratch whilst trying to keep the overall theme of loss and acceptence in tact. Instead of having 5 levels there will now be one giant level with 3 sections (attic, bedroom, basement) and the movement controls and mechanics have been simplified indefinitely or when we meet schecule deadlines. This change was unfortunate as I wanted to trust the designers reassurance that he would get everything done on time, however, they never delivered. I have also diminished the designers rights and I am now acting as lead designer and I have stationed the old designer to doing backround assets and sound design.

## Camera System
- originally the player camera was going to be static and fly to the next room when the player walked into it, However, I found the spline to be finicky so I gave the camera a more standard look. If I have some spare time I will look into creating it again. But for now the camera works as intended. 
- Detail any innovative or new approaches you explored during the project.  
- Explain why these approaches were chosen and how they differ from standard practices.  
- Evaluate the success of these approaches, including any challenges faced and lessons learned.

## 2 player system

- I have scrapped the 2 player system and instead I have one sprite followed by a small ghost to give the same effect.

## Story

- Originally the game was supposed to have 5 levels each representing a different stage of grief which had to unfortunetly be scrapped, as well as the old dialogue system as it did not make any sense anymore. Then the game got cut down to 3 levels but the third level didn't really get worken on. It was then cut down to one level but again it was never really worked on so it had to be scrapped. It is now down to one level with all of the story gone besides some subtle hints.

## Flashlight System

- Unfortunetly the flashlight system had to be completely removed from the game as it was useless. It was originally going to be used on ghosts and turn them into normal platforms when the light was shining on it but due to time constraints it had to be scrapped.

## Rope Swing

- The rope swing had to be repurposed into a jump pad as the rope which was Unreal's own wire was very hard to work with and making a jump pad was faster.

### Testing

- During testing I was made aware of many bugs such as Infinite shadow platforms, Camera issues, 
- I mainly let the playtesters blind test as I didn't want to hold their hands through the whole game. I noticed alot of the struggled with the first set of jumps so I tried to make them easier by reajusting.
- Because of the jumps manmy testers thought it was a bit hard to pass though the section.

- These were some of the common complaints, such as no background music which was later added, Fixed dialogue, and text wrapping.
- I also did fix the precise jump but I found out too late that it was broken again and I do not have time to fix it anymore.

## Broken tester videos

- One of my testers documented all of the bugs and sent me recordings so I could reflect back onto them.

## Technical Difficulties

## Camera System

- The camera is not looking at the correct location, cannot rotate camera
- Identify any technical difficulties encountered during the implementation phase.  
- I was having an issue of being able to turn the camera even though the game was in 2D making the movement controls weird. This was a simple fix I just added the mouse onto the screen all the time to disable camera movement. It is also set up for the power mechanics which will need the mouse to operate.

- Provide details on how these issues were diagnosed and resolved.  
- If any difficulties remain unresolved, explain the impact on the project and any mitigation strategies used to minimise their effect.  
- Reflect on what you would do differently in future projects to avoid similar issues.

## Flash Light System
- After asking Copilot to help me create a Flashlight I noticed a bug, the code would work perfectly when I turned to face the left the code would not work as intended.

## Reflection
- After working in a group I realised that choosing reliable team members is a must, having just one team member not play their part can have a devastating effect on the production progress and put more work onto my plate in the longrun. After some thought my next game will be a solo project and I may use the original idea of my prototype.

- I should have also stopped putting off work as it added more work for me later on, causing delays for the timeline I had set for myself.

### Research Effectiveness  
- Assess the usefulness of the research conducted during the project.  
- Highlight which sources (games, academic, documentation) had the most significant impact on your work and explain why.  
- Identify any research gaps or areas where additional information could have improved your project outcomes.

### Positive Analysis 
- I enjoyed working on this project applying what i know into the project to create a better and more efficient game then I would have been able to do before.

- I liked the challenge of creating a 2.5D game as it allowed me to learn how to do some things differently such as, changing the camera and movement systems.

### Group Positive Analysis
- Working as a group has been positive in some ways as it is nice to give everyone their designated tasks to help split the workload as a whole.

- I enjoyed managing my group and giving them different asignments to help improve the game, from asking my artist to create different assets that will help improve the games overall storytelling, to asking my designer to create music using the different themes and instruments I chose to make the music more immersive and emotional.

### Negative Analysis
- Working on this project has taught me about the importance of team communication, as I have learned that miscommunication or missed group deadlines can almost halt the team workflow.

- During this project I took on the role of a unofficial team leader, I didn't feel confident in this role and found it increased my workload quite significantly. My initial thought that the game designer who created the original idea for the game would take on that role. However, the designer did not contribute as much to the project as i hoped he would. This lead to missed group deadlines that I organised, as well as tension within the group. To help the team workflow I reassigned the designer to simpler tasks. Such as, background level and audio design.   

- If I were to create this project again, I would make sure that the roles and responsibilities given out would better suit my team members to avoid missed deadlines and help communication.


### Next Time

- If I was to do this project again I would make sure that I chose team members that would do their part to ensure that the game is completed in a timely manner.

-I would have made sure that they would update the trello board often this time so I could better see where they were struggling or if they needed more time to do something.

- I Would also make sure the game would be less ambitious before as originally there were going to be five levels, which is possible but I need to consider things going wrong like it has here, then if I am ahead of scedule I could add stretch goals to help polish the game and make it more publishable.

- One thing I struggled with last time was documentation as I would just put everything I did into the notes making it unorganised and hard to find what I am looking for immedietly, costing me time that could be spent on working on the project.
